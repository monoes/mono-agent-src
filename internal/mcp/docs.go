	"publication": `PUBLICATION HISTORY

A profile's local history of successful posts, comments, replies,
articles, videos and shared channel posts. Built-in publishing operations register
success automatically from workflows, direct node runs and agent automations.
Reads, likes, follows, drafts and private messages are excluded.

Read: publication_list (search/platform/kind/workflow_id/agent_id/since/until/limit/offset),
publication_get (id), publication_stats. Registration requires --allow-mutations:
publication_register (platform, kind, title/body/url/media, remote_id, parent_url,
account, published_at, workflow_id/execution_id/node_id, agent_id/org_id/role_id,
idempotency_key). It records already-published content; it never publishes.

Agents using external tools must register each successful publication, with exact
published content and returned identity. Custom workflow publishers can attach a
publication.register node downstream. Stable idempotency keys prevent repeated
registration; a genuinely new publication needs a new key. Do not include secrets.

CLI: monoagentcli --json publication list|get|stats;
monoagentcli --json publication register --stdin-json < publication.json.
History starts when installed; external publishing bypassing mono-agent requires
explicit registration. Tracking failures must not trigger another remote publish.`,

automatically from stored connections when credential_id is set (or by
platform name derived from the node type).`,

	"workflow": `WORKFLOW JSON FORMAT (file store: ~/.monoagent/workflows/<id>.json; create new workflows with workflow import or the workflow tools: a new file dropped into the folder is not picked up)

{
  "id":   "my-workflow-v1",       // must match the filename
  "name": "My Workflow",
  "is_active": false,
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "n1", "type": "trigger.schedule", "name": "Daily",
      "position": {"x":100,"y":100},
      "config": {"cron": "0 0 9 * * *"} }
  ],
  "connections": [
    { "id": "c1", "source": "n1", "source_handle": "main",
      "target": "n2", "target_handle": "main" }
  ]
}

Rules enforced by validation (workflow_validate / workflow validate):
  - non-empty name; 1-200 nodes; 0-500 connections
  - unique node IDs; every connection references existing nodes
  - no cycles, except a loop: an edge from a core.split_in_batches
    node's loop body back into it; non-empty source_handle
  - activation additionally requires >=1 trigger.* node, and
    trigger.schedule needs "cron", trigger.webhook needs "path"

Parallel branches: one source -> several targets run concurrently;
rejoin with core.merge. Prefer instantiating a bundled template
(workflow templates use <id>) over hand-building JSON.`,

	"templates": `BUNDLED TEMPLATES (ready-to-run workflows shipped with the binary)

  workflow templates list                    Browse IDs + input keys
  workflow templates show <id>               Description, nodes, run command
  workflow templates run <id> --input '{...}'  One-off run, nothing saved
  workflow templates use <id>                Save an editable copy (inactive)
  workflow search [query]                    Search templates + saved workflows

Each template declares its trigger-data inputs ("INPUT KEYS"); pass them as
a JSON object via --input (MCP: the workflow_run tool's "input" arg after
saving, or run the CLI command directly). Templates start inactive so
credentials can be filled in before activation. Runs are isolated: each
templates-run invocation gets fresh node IDs, so concurrent runs never
collide.`,

	"connections": `CONNECTIONS, CREDENTIALS & PROFILES

Profiles scope everything (workflows, connections, people, HIL queue,
secrets). Every command that acts on a profile takes --profile <id|name>; there
is no active profile. This server holds no profile either: every tool that acts
on a profile takes a required "profile" argument (id or name) on each call, and
a call without it is refused with the list of profiles. A workflow saved under
one profile cannot run under another, and another profile's records are not found.

Connections ('monoagentcli connect <platform>') store OAuth tokens /
API keys in an encrypted vault (keyring-wrapped key, AES-256-GCM). Nodes
resolve credentials by:
  1. explicit config field credential_id (connection ID or platform name)
  2. platform name derived from the node type (service.google_sheets ->
     google_sheets), scoped to the profile
OAuth tokens refresh automatically before expiry.

Secrets for config values: prefer the vault (secret add, value via stdin) —
never paste tokens into workflow JSON. Browser-based nodes (gemini.*, and
social platforms) need a saved login session
('monoagentcli login <platform>') instead of API keys.`,
	"org": `ORGS, AUTOMATIONS & AUTONOMY (full text: monoagentcli ref org)

An org is a team of agent roles run by monomind; config at
<profile folder>/.monomind/orgs/<name>.json. Needs 'monoagentcli org serve'
(org daemon) and 'monoagentcli daemon' (runs automations, endpoint, decisions).

Automations: 'org automation add <org> --workflow <id> --alias <alias>'.
Grants: 'org grant add <org> --role <id> --automation <alias>' gives the role
the tool monoagent__automation_<alias>; outbound workflows need a decision per
call by default. Automation roles: 'org automation-role add <org> --alias <a>
--reports-to <role>' — messages to the role run the workflow, and its output
is the reply. Grants and endpoints are enforced from the database; edits to
the org file cannot create them.

Nodes: org.run (wait, exclusive), org.send, org.ask, trigger.org (event or
endpoint mode). Crossings carry [trace chn_… hop=N]; max_hops 8.

Autonomy: 'org autonomy set <org> --level manual|mid|full --decider
model|boss|parent|jev [--decider-threshold 0.8]'. jev: TypeSafe Jev picks the
verdict when its top probability reaches the threshold (needs a TypeSafe
key); questions and anything below it go to the model decider. mid: rules approve routine, the decider handles
consequential, a person irreversible. full: the decider handles everything
above routine. 'org autonomy pause <org> --for 30m' drops to manual.
Holding orgs: kind "holding", children[]; 'org group init <holding>'.`,
